# odin-recipes
# Just testing a little bit of Git and how to add repositories
# its working just fine, I think i'm confident enough with the typing 
# what remains now is for me to master how to code
# this will help me a lot when i doing projects on my own
# javascript is my starter language but il be going deeper with time in this odin project
